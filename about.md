I am Fatih Güçlü Akkaya, born in Istanbul/ Turkey, currently living in Munich/ Germany. My dream is to see and live in most of the cities in the world. The blog page will consists of short summaries about thoughts on random stuff. However there will also IT related topics as well, since main profession is Software Development.
