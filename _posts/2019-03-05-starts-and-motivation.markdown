Finally started to put together my blog website powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Since it is a start of my blog posts and feeling motivated to continue, I want to write something about 'Motivation, Starts and Resumes'.

`Starts` are difficult. One, two weeks or even months a motivation suddenly appears, forces us to start with something new in our life. For me it was starting to write a blog. Of course my motivations are not only limit to blogging and i know it is same for other people too. However while having the motivation, initiating the 'Start' is alway interrupted by some conditions, which are actually created and imposed by ourselves. For instance before starting to write my blog, I tend to postpone the starting point due to being too tired from work, having go to gym, meeting with friends etc. Another important reason for postponing my 'Start' is basically my overestimatement of the workload for starting something. However now I have started writing the blog and thanks to `Github Pages` and `Jekyll` it took me 30 minutes to setup the site generator and writing this blog post. As the reader can see, this blog post will be a short one. Basically keep your `Starts` short and simple.

`Resumes` are even more difficult. In most cases progress of the 'started' action can be interrupted by many circumstances. Positives ones like vacation, hobbies, friends or negatives ones like sickness, trauma etc. Whether positive or negative these actions unfortunately makes us forget our initial `Motivation` and thus stopping the progress. After a while the progress and motivation will vanish. `Motivation` is a fleeing thing. It will disappear over time after you started something and will not come back if you stopped progressing, thus `Resume` will never happen. However progress still has an output and we could at the improvement potential of the output. So if we believe, the work we have done has a lot of improvement to be done, a new `Motivation` may arise.

In summary, make your `Starts` short and simple like this blog. If you ever stopped progressing, look at the improvement potential and gaing your new `Motivation`, thus `Resume` with progress.
